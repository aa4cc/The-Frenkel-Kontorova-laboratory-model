The assembly guide shows, how to make following things:
1. Frame
2. Pendulum segment
3. FPGA shield
4. Miscellaneous
We consider a platform with 25 pendulums and 2 motors.

# 1. Frame
The frame is constructed from aluminium profile 


# 2. Pendulum segment
The pendulum segment is designed as a combination of off-the-shelf and 3D-printed components. The sub-components are:  
- Springs: 
	- Required quantity: 26
	- Type: off-the-shelf: T048-360-406R
