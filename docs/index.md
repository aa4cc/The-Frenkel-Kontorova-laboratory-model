# Introduction
The Frenkel-Kontorova laboratory model is an multi-pendulum platform that we developed as a testbed for control algorithms for this class of dynamical systems, for instance, distributed control or control of flexible structures.

## Pendulum segment
3D model of one segment of the model is available at:
- <https://a360.co/3uP4RIG>

The segment is constructed as a combination of off-the-shelf and 3D-printed components.

## Motors and drivers
The motors actuating the chain are NEMA17 1.8Â° stepper motors controlled by Pololu Tic T249 drivers. Information about drivers is available at:
- <https://www.pololu.com/product/3138>

## Data acquisition
The angles of the pendulums are measured by rotaty encoders AMT132S-V by CUI.

To rapidly process all measurements, we designed a custom-made shield for FPGA board.
